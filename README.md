# is-an-image-url
This package was originally created as an async replacement for is-image-url.  I was using that one but my sync security scanner said there was issue with one of the dependencies.  I posted a pull request but it hasn't been reviewed, so onward and upward.  The other lib was synchronisis, I figured I'd make an async version.
